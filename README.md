# IS 601 - Homework 5, Calculator Design Patterns
## Homework Objectives
### Continue to build off of Homework #4
1. Make my Calculator interactive with REPL and Command Pattern. - [ ]
  * Integrate these new concepts into my existing program from Homework #4 to be able to add four basic commands: Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide.

2. (BONUS) Implement a Menu Command - [ ]
  * Create a menu command that displays available commands from the command ditionary at the application's srtat and when the user types 'menu'. Do this to reinforce dynamic command integration.

3. Testing and Code Coverage - [ ]
  * Once calculator commands are integrated, update and expand tests to achieve a full 100% coverage, to ensure this calculator's functionality is fully verified.

4. Plugin Architecture - [ ]
  * Now, refactor my program to automatically load plugins, making it easier to provide command additions without manual updates.

5. (BONUS) Explore Multiprocessing Capabilities - [ ]
  * See about adding multiprocessing features to enable commands/plugins to run on separate cores. This is to ensure application can be scalable and can ensure performance improvements in the future.
